A simple game made my me. It's just a simple obstacle avoiding race (I've made it kinda challenging by increasing the speed of the player model) and it shouldn't take too long to finish. Probably just 2 or 3 minutes. Have fun!
Controls are: A and D for moving side to side, you won't need anything else! This is a project I made long ago so I don't remember everything I added, but this is all you need to know to play this. Enjoy!
